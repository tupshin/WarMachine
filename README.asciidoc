# WarMachine

Very preliminary end to end functionality.

** Reads config from a toml file
** Connects to a Cassandra instance with contact points specified in the toml
** Creates a sample foo.bar keyspace and table if they don't exist
** Populates foo.bar with two rows
** If you browse to http://localhost:8087/foo/execute/select%20*%20from%20foo.bar you should get results in your browser. The initial foo is not currently used except for rustful routing
